<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
            participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
            the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
            found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
            in death.</p>

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.[2]

            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It
            was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.[3]

            With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking
            Thranduil.[4] They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached
            Lake-town.[5] The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the
            river.[6]

            At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and
            Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.[7]

            Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five
            Armies, and all three were buried with honor.</p>
